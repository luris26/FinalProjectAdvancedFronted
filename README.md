# Restaurant Inventory Management System

## Elevator Pitch
This project aims to replace the manual inventory process at my mother's restaurant with a digital system to track daily sales, expenses, popular items, payments, and cash register closures. This will streamline operations, provide accurate sales data, and help in better financial management and inventory tracking.
